# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_Project

* Our goal is to create an API in which the user enters a topic, which will then search on Twitter and extracts tweets related to the topic.
* Then Sentiment Analysis is done using TextBlob library on the extracted tweets and classify them into different polarities like positive, negative and neutral.
* We also provide different visualizations on the data. So that it could be further analysed by the user.
